\title{Get a crosswalk(s) to translate data across time and geographies}
\usage{
get_crosswalk(
  source_geography,
  target_geography,
  source_year = NULL,
  target_year = NULL,
  cache = NULL,
  weight = "population"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{source_geography}{Character. Source geography name. One of c("block",
"block group", "tract", "place", "county", "urban_area", "zcta", "puma", "cd118",
"cd119", "urban_area", "core_based_statistical_area").}

\item{target_geography}{Character. Target geography name. One of c("block",
"block group", "tract", "place", "county", "urban_area", "zcta", "puma", "cd118",
"cd119", "urban_area", "core_based_statistical_area").}

\item{source_year}{Character or numeric. Year of the source geography, one of
c(1990, 2000, 2010, 2020).}

\item{target_year}{Character or numeric. Year of the target geography, one of
c(1990, 2000, 2010, 2020) for decennial crosswalks, or c(2011, 2012, 2014,
2015, 2022) for non-census year crosswalks (limited to block groups, tracts,
and counties).}

\item{cache}{Directory path. Where to download the crosswalk to. If NULL (default),
crosswalk is returned but not saved to disk. Individual component crosswalks
are cached separately when provided.}

\item{weight}{Character. Weighting variable for Geocorr crosswalks. One of
c("population", "housing", "land").}
}
\value{
A list with a consistent structure:
\describe{
\item{crosswalks}{A named list of crosswalk tibbles (step_1, step_2, etc.).
Single-step transformations have one crosswalk; multi-step have two or more.}
\item{plan}{The crosswalk plan describing the transformation steps}
\item{message}{A formatted message describing the crosswalk chain}
}

Each crosswalk tibble includes an attribute \code{crosswalk_metadata} (access via
\code{attr(result$crosswalks$step_1, "crosswalk_metadata")}) containing comprehensive
information about how the crosswalk was produced.

Columns in returned crosswalk dataframes (some may not be present depending on source):
\describe{
\item{source_geoid}{A unique identifier for the source geography}
\item{target_geoid}{A unique identifier for the target geography}
\item{source_geography_name}{The name of the source geography}
\item{target_geography_name}{The name of the target geography}
\item{source_year}{The year of the source geography}
\item{target_year}{The year of the target geography}
\item{allocation_factor_source_to_target}{The weight to interpolate values
from the source geography to the target geography}
\item{allocation_factor_target_to_source}{The weight to interpolate values
from the target geography to the source geography}
\item{population_2020}{The estimated overlap in population, if applicable}
\item{housing_2020}{The estimated overlap in housing units, if applicable}
\item{land_area_sqmi}{The overlap in land area, if applicable}
\item{weighting_factor}{The attribute used to calculate allocation factors}
\item{state_fips}{Two-digit state FIPS code, if applicable}
}
}
\description{
Retrieves a crosswalk with interpolation values from a source geography to a target
geography, optionally across different years. Always returns a list with a consistent
structure containing one or more crosswalk tibbles.
}
\details{
This function sources crosswalks from Geocorr 2022, IPUMS NHGIS, and
CT Data Collaborative. Crosswalk weights are from the original sources and
have not been modified; this function merely standardizes the format of the
returned crosswalks and enables easy programmatic access and caching.

\strong{Multi-step crosswalks}: When both geography AND year change (e.g.,
2010 tracts to 2020 ZCTAs), no single crosswalk source provides this directly.
This function returns multiple crosswalks that should be applied sequentially:
\enumerate{
\item First crosswalk changes year (via NHGIS): source_geog(source_year) -> source_geog(target_year)
\item Second crosswalk changes geography (via Geocorr): source_geog(target_year) -> target_geog(target_year)
}

\strong{Non-census year support}: For target years 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2022,
crosswalks are available only for block groups, tracts, and counties. These
years correspond to American Community Survey geography changes.

\strong{2020 to 2022 crosswalks}: The 2022 geographic changes only affected
Connecticut (county-equivalent planning regions replaced historical counties).
For this case, the function combines CT Data Collaborative crosswalks for
Connecticut with identity mappings for other states.

Note that an IPUMS NHGIS API key is required to access crosswalks from that
source. Use \code{usethis::edit_r_environ(scope = "user")} to save your API key
to your .Renviron; the name of the key should be "IPUMS_API_KEY". You can
obtain a key from: https://account.ipums.org/api_keys.
