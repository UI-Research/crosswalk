# crosswalk

An R interface to inter-geography and inter-temporal crosswalks.

## Overview

This package provides a consistent API and standardized versions of
crosswalks to enable consistent approaches that work across different
geography and year combinations. The package also facilitates
interpolation–that is, adjusting source geography/year values by their
crosswalk weights and translating these values to the desired target
geography/year–including diagnostics of the joins between source data
and crosswalks.

The package sources crosswalks from:

- **Geocorr 2022** (Missouri Census Data Center) - for same-year
  crosswalks between geographies
- **IPUMS NHGIS** - for inter-temporal crosswalks (across different
  census years)
- **CT Data Collaborative** - for Connecticut 2020→2022 crosswalks
  (planning region changes)

## Why Use `crosswalk`?

- **Programmatic access**: No more manual downloads from web interfaces
- **Standardized output**: Consistent column names across all crosswalk
  sources
- **Metadata tracking**: Full provenance stored as attributes
- **Multi-step handling**: Automatic chaining when both geography and
  year change
- **Local caching**: Reproducible workflows with cached crosswalks

## Overview

First we obtain a crosswalk and apply it to our data:

``` r
library(crosswalk)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(sf)

source_data = tidycensus::get_acs(
    year = 2023,
    geography = "zcta",
    output = "wide",
    variables = c(below_poverty_level = "B17001_002")) %>%
  dplyr::select(
    source_geoid = GEOID,
    count_below_poverty_level = below_poverty_levelE)

# Get a crosswalk from ZCTAs to PUMAs (same year, uses Geocorr (2022))
zcta_puma_crosswalk <- get_crosswalk(
  source_geography = "zcta",
  target_geography = "puma22",
  weight = "population")

# Apply the crosswalk to your data
crosswalked_data <- crosswalk_data(
  data = source_data,
  crosswalk = zcta_puma_crosswalk)

## Or in a single step
crosswalked_data = crosswalk_data(
  data = source_data,
  source_geography = "zcta",
  target_geography = "puma22",
  weight = "population")
```

What does the crosswalk(s) reflect and how was it sourced?

``` r

How well did the crosswalk join to our source data?

``` r
## look at all the characteristics of the join(s) between the source data
## and the crosswalks
join_quality = attr(crosswalked_data, "join_quality")

## what share of records in the source data do not join to a crosswalk and
## thus are dropped during the crosswalking process?
join_quality$pct_data_unmatched
#> [1] 0.4234277

## zctas aren't nested within states, otherwise join_quality$state_analysis_data 
## would help us to ID whether non-joining source data were clustered within one
## or a few states. instead we can join to spatial data to diagnose further:
zctas_sf = tigris::zctas(year = 2023)

## Core Functions

The package has two main functions:

| Function                                                                                  | Purpose                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`get_crosswalk()`](https://ui-research.github.io/crosswalk/reference/get_crosswalk.md)   | Fetch crosswalk(s)                                                  |
| [`crosswalk_data()`](https://ui-research.github.io/crosswalk/reference/crosswalk_data.md) | Apply crosswalk(s) to interpolate data to the target geography-year |

## Understanding `get_crosswalk()` Output

[`get_crosswalk()`](https://ui-research.github.io/crosswalk/reference/get_crosswalk.md)
**always returns a list** structured as follows:

``` r
result <- get_crosswalk(
  source_geography = "tract",
  target_geography = "zcta",
  source_year = 2010,
  target_year = 2020,
  weight = "population"
)

names(result)
#> [1] "crosswalks" "plan"       "message"
#> [1] "crosswalks" "plan" "message"
```

The list contains three elements:

| Element      | Description                                                                    |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `crosswalks` | A named list of crosswalks (`step_1`, `step_2`, etc.) of length one or greater |
| `plan`       | Details about what crosswalks are being fetched                                |
| `message`    | A human-readable description of the crosswalk chain                            |

### Single-Step vs. Multi-Step Crosswalks

**Single-step crosswalks** (same year, different geography OR same
geography, different year):

``` r
# Same year, different geography (Geocorr)
result <- get_crosswalk(
  source_geography = "tract",
  target_geography = "zcta",
  weight = "population"
)
# result$crosswalks$step_1 contains one crosswalk

# Same geography, different year (NHGIS)
result <- get_crosswalk(
  source_geography = "tract",
  target_geography = "tract",
  source_year = 2010,
  target_year = 2020
)
# result$crosswalks$step_1 contains one crosswalk
```

**Multi-step crosswalks** (different geography AND different year):

When both geography and year change, no single crosswalk source provides
this directly. The package automatically plans and fetches a two-step
chain:

1.  **Step 1 (NHGIS)**: Change year, keep geography constant
2.  **Step 2 (Geocorr)**: Change geography at target year

``` r
result <- get_crosswalk(
  source_geography = "tract",
  target_geography = "zcta",
  source_year = 2010,
  target_year = 2020,
  weight = "population"
)

# Two crosswalks are returned
names(result$crosswalks)
#> [1] "step_1" "step_2"
#> [1] "step_1" "step_2"

# Step 1: 2010 tracts -> 2020 tracts (NHGIS)
# Step 2: 2020 tracts -> 2020 ZCTAs (Geocorr)
```

### Crosswalk Structure

Each crosswalk contains standardized columns:

| Column                               | Description                                         |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `source_geoid`                       | Identifier for source geography                     |
| `target_geoid`                       | Identifier for target geography                     |
| `allocation_factor_source_to_target` | Weight for interpolating values                     |
| `weighting_factor`                   | What attribute was used (population, housing, land) |

Additional columns may include `source_year`, `target_year`,
`population_2020`, `housing_2020`, and `land_area_sqmi` depending on the
source.

### Accessing Metadata

Each crosswalk tibble has a `crosswalk_metadata` attribute that
documents what the crosswalk represents and how it was created:

``` r
metadata <- attr(result$crosswalks$step_1, "crosswalk_metadata")
names(metadata)
#>  [1] "call_parameters"               "data_source"                  
#>  [3] "data_source_full_name"         "download_url"                 
#>  [5] "api_endpoint"                  "documentation_url"            
#>  [7] "citation_url"                  "github_repository"            
#>  [9] "source_geography"              "source_geography_standardized"
#> [11] "target_geography"              "target_geography_standardized"
#> [13] "source_year"                   "target_year"                  
#> [15] "reference_year"                "weighting_variable"           
#> [17] "state_coverage"                "notes"                        
#> [19] "retrieved_at"                  "cached"                       
#> [21] "cache_path"                    "read_from_cache"              
#> [23] "is_multi_step"                 "crosswalk_package_version"
#> [1] "call_parameters" "data_source" "data_source_full_name" "download_url" ...
```

## Using `crosswalk_data()` to Interpolate Data

[`crosswalk_data()`](https://ui-research.github.io/crosswalk/reference/crosswalk_data.md)
applies crosswalk weights to transform your data. It automatically
handles multi-step crosswalks.

### Column Naming Convention

The function auto-detects columns based on prefixes:

| Prefix                                   | Treatment                                                          |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `count_`                                 | Summed after weighting (for counts like population, housing units) |
| `mean_`, `median_`, `percent_`, `ratio_` | Weighted mean (for rates, percentages, averages)                   |

You can also specify columns explicitly via `count_columns` and
`non_count_columns`. All non-count variables are interpolated using
weighted means, weighting by the allocation factor from the crosswalk.

## Supported Geography and Year Combinations

### Inter-Geography Crosswalks (Geocorr)

2022-vintage crosswalks between any of these geographies:

- block, block group, tract, county
- place, zcta, puma22
- cd118, cd119, urban_area, core_based_statistical_area

### Inter-Temporal Crosswalks (NHGIS)

NHGIS provides cross-decade crosswalks with the following structure:

**Source geographies:** block, block_group, tract

**Target geographies:** - From blocks (decennial years only): block,
block_group, tract, county, place, zcta, puma, urban_area, cbsa - From
block_group or tract: block_group, tract, county

| Source Years                 | Target Years                 |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1990, 2000                   | 2010, 2014, 2015, 2020, 2022 |
| 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015 | 1990, 2000, 2020, 2022       |
| 2020, 2022                   | 1990, 2000, 2010, 2014, 2015 |

**Notes:** - Within-decade crosswalks (e.g., 2010→2014) are not
available from NHGIS - Block→ZCTA, Block→PUMA, etc. are only available
for decennial years (1990, 2000, 2010, 2020) - The package automatically
uses direct NHGIS crosswalks when available (e.g.,
`get_crosswalk(source_geography = "block", target_geography = "zcta", source_year = 2010, target_year = 2020)`
returns a single-step NHGIS crosswalk)

### 2020→2022 Crosswalks (CTData)

For 2020 to 2022 transformations, the package uses CT Data Collaborative
crosswalks for Connecticut (where planning regions replaced counties)
and identity mappings for other states (where no changes occurred).

## API Keys

NHGIS crosswalks require an IPUMS API key. Get one at
<https://account.ipums.org/api_keys> and add to your `.Renviron`:

``` r
usethis::edit_r_environ()
# Add: IPUMS_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Caching

Use the `cache` parameter to save crosswalks locally for ease:

``` r
result <- get_crosswalk(
  source_geography = "tract",
  target_geography = "zcta",
  weight = "population",
  cache = here::here("crosswalks-cache"))
```

## Citations
